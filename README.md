# Multilingual Batch OCR System for High Accuracy Digitization of Scanned PDFs

A Python-based multilingual batch OCR system designed to convert scanned PDF
documents into high-accuracy, searchable, and selectable PDFs using
Tesseract OCR and Poppler.

This project focuses on practical document digitization, especially for
scanned documents where OCR quality is often poor.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many scanned PDF documents (such as books, notes, reports, and official
documents) are image-based and cannot be searched or digitally processed.
Although some scanned PDFs may allow basic search, the extracted text is
often inaccurate, incomplete, or poorly encoded.

This system addresses the need for **reliable, batch OCR processing** with
better text accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Convert scanned PDFs into searchable PDFs
- Support multilingual OCR (Tamil and English)
- Process multiple PDFs in batch mode
- Preserve document layout while adding a clean text layer
- Provide a simple and reusable OCR pipeline

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

**Step 1: Install Python libraries**
```bash
pip install pytesseract pdf2image pypdf pillow
```
**Step 2: Install system dependencies**
Install Tesseract OCR with Tamil (tam) and English (eng) language data
Tesseract OCR Download (official)
```bash
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesser
```
🧩 For Windows installers directly
Use the builds from the UB Mannheim repo (stable Windows releases):
```bash
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```
You’ll find links there for:
Windows 64-bit installer
Tamil (tam) and English (eng) language support

Install Poppler for Windows
```bash
https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases
```

**Step 3: Add input PDFs**
Place all scanned PDF files inside the input/ folder.
input/
 ├── file1.pdf
 ├── file2.pdf

**Step 4: Run OCR**
```bash
python tamil_ocr_task.py
```
**Step 5: Get output**
OCR-processed PDFs will be available in the output/ folder.

output/
 ├── file1.pdf
 ├── file2.pdf

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

-Digitization of scanned books and notes

-Government or institutional document archiving

-Making scanned PDFs searchable for analysis

-Preprocessing documents for NLP or data extraction tasks

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

-Use lang='tam+eng' only for mixed-language documents

-For English-only PDFs, using lang='eng' improves speed and accuracy

-OCR quality depends on scan clarity and resolution

---
## 🔮 Future Enhancements

-Image preprocessing for improved OCR accuracy

-Automatic language detection

-OCR confidence scoring

-Export extracted text to TXT or DOCX formats

-GUI-based interface
